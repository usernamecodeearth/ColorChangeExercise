# ColorChangeExercise
Practice using DOM elements to create a random color changing background when user clicks button.

After taking some time to review JS even more. I created a random color changing app in about 30 mins. One of the hiccups i encountered was having the colors only appear in random mochromatic grayscale rather than full color. Solved that by using different variables for each rgb number that produce a random number up to 255.
